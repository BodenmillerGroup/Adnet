# adnet/bpR2 analysis

This repository contains the analysis scripts used for the paper:
"Influence of node abundance on signaling network state and dynamics analyzed by mass cytometry"
Xiao-Kang Lun, Vito RT Zanotelli, James D Wade, Denis Schapiro, Marco Tognetti, Nadine Dobberstein & Bernd Bodenmiller

# Installation:
The package can be installed using the python package manager pip. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended.
The code is compatible with both Python2 and Python3. The installation was tested on Ubuntu 14.04, but is expected to work
as well on other installations.

1) clone the github repsitory:
`git clone https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/Adnet.git`

2) install it with pip:
`pip install -e ./Adnet`

The dependencies ('numpy', 'scipy', 'pandas','matplotlib', 'seaborn',  'configparser2','nose', 'argparse') should be
automatically installed.

# Analysis workflow:
The analysis consists of a main workflow which is configured using a '.ini' configuration file and the data organized in
a specific folder structure. Ipython notebooks are used for the downstream analysis and further visualization of the
results.

### File structure requirements:
The overall folder structure should be as follows:

- Experiment:
    a folder corresponding to one cyTOF experiment, that can contain multiple barcoding plates.
    - AcquisitionA:
        a folder corresponding to an cyTOF acquisition barcoding plate. Contains:
        - AcquisitionA.csv:
            A csv file with the metadata, see example for exact structure.

        - gated: a folder containing the data
            - xy_rowcolumn_xy.fcs: fcs files with '_' seperated fields in the name and the rowcolumn information.


    - AcquisitionB: identical structure

- name_dict.csv:
    a comma seperated files with 2 columns:
        old, new
        old: column name as used in the .fcs file
        new: renamed column name as should be used in the analysis plots. Non ASCII characters can give problems.
   

- config.ini:
    a configuration file with all the parameters used for the analysis. Please look at the specifications in the example
    file 'example/config_documentation.ini'

### Run analysis

After installation of the package (above) the analysis can be run as follows:

```
python -m adnet.adnet_analysis /pathto/config.ini
```
### Output

Depending on the settings of the config.ini file, the following output will be generated:

- outfolder: folder defined in the config.ini
    - config.ini: a copy of the config.ini used for the analysis

    - bin_dat: a pandas pickle file containing the summary statistics generated by the analysis.
                Can be loaded as pandas.read_pickle("bin_dat")

    - complete_dat: a pandas pickle file containing the single cell data used by the analysis.
                Can be loaded as pandas.read_pickle("complete_dat")

    - Cutoff.pdf: the histogram showing the cutoff chosen in relation to the negative controls

    - Plots as png, pdf: plots are strongly depending on the configuration specified in the file.



# Examples

In the root directory is an 'example' folder which contains configuration files for 3 example analyses from the
paper. 

**Please change the paths in the config ini file to match the current repository location!**

Afterwards the analysis can be run as follows:

```
python -m adnet.adnet_analysis /pathto/Adnet/example/config_xxx.ini
```

### Main analysis
Runs the bpR2 analysis for the 20 overexpressions. Because of data storage reasons only 2 replicates of 1 overession group is included
in this repository. However the other folders are already prepared and the FCS files from the data repository
simply need to be copied in. To activate the other folders just uncomment the folder section.

### Mutations analysis
Runs the bpR2 analysis for the mutation data. All data included.

### Tag analysis
Runs the bpR2 analysis for the comparison of differentially tagged overexpressions, i.e. Flag-N, Flag-C, GFP-N, GFP-C
